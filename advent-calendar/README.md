# JavaScript advent calendar

Scripts for a simple advent calendar which produces a random image when a box is clicked. The calendar is implemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. To make the grid layout for the calendar, the Bootstrap CSS plugin has been used.

To make it work you need to find your own images...

+ Download the scripts and create an images directory in the same location
+ Create a background image for the calendar called `bg.jpg`
+ Create 24 'door' images named `0.jpg` -> `23.jpg`

**What else might you want to do to this calendar or how might you repurpose it?** *Play...*
